Hi,nice to meet you.
This is my first time doing this project so please understand if i do not do well.
I am a student in Singapore and my name is Cheryl.
I like to play games, eat, watch dramas and travel to other countries.
I like to eat different types of cuisines like korean,japanese, western and many more.
I also like cold items like ice cream and bingsu. Even a cold soft drink is counted.
Although I like to eat, i cannot take spicy so I missed out on many wonderful spicy food like the spicy mc chicken.
My favourite food in the world is crabs. The plesure of peeling of the shell just to eat that small part of meat is really interesting.
Though i like to eat crabs, it is quite expensive as one crab is around $50-$60 so i spent time finding shops which sells cheaper but good crabs and after an hour of searching, I found a shop that sells 3 crabs for $60.
Till now, i still haven't asked my dad to bring me to that shop because i forgot about it until i wrote this thing.
I laso like hotpot.
This is not a story.****
Thank you for your time.
Have a nice day ahead.
:)
